In ancient times, the Demon Lord ruled these lands.
The anguish and terror he spread during his reign made the lives of the innocents an inescapable hell. 
One fateful day, however, a brave few gathered strength and rebelled against their fiendish overlord. 
These heroes would overthrow the Demon Lord and bring about a new age of peace and prosperity!
Unfortunately, the Demon Lord could not be destroyed in his entirety. In a last ditch effort, the heroes contained their adversary inside his own fortress. 
Knowing that the bonds would not last forever, the ancient heroes established a brotherhood we recognize today as The Guild. 
The Guild would gather future heroes for training and adventuring as a means of honing them into the perfect warriors capable of exercising the Demon Lord from this plane of existence for good. 
You…are no such hero.”

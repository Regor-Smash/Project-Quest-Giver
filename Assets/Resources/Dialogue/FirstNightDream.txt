*As you drift off into a deep sleep, you feel an uneasy queasiness stake your psyche*

???: “Morttalll…”

You: “Ehrrm…W-who…?

???: “Ooopenn yyyoourrr sssoulll tooo mmeee…”

*You awake in the dream*

DEMON LORD: “BWUAHAHA! THANKS FOR LETTING ME IN, YOU IMBECILE! I THINK I’LL LIKE IT HERE!”

You: “W-what? How did you? Why are you?”

DEMON LORD" “HAVE A SEAT THERE BUDDY. LEMME FILL YOU IN. 
YOU SEE- I WAS ENJOYING MY DAY TODAY,
TRAPPED IN MY HELLISH EXILE, 
WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN A GROUP OF HEROES BROKE IN MY FRONT DOOR. 
THEY KILLED COUNTLESS OF MY SUBORDINATE DEMON GUARDSMEN, 
DESTROYED NUMEROUS TREASURES AND ARTIFACTS FROM MY COLLECTION, 
AND TRACKED MUD ALL OVER MY THRONE ROOM! 
ALL OFFENSIVE IN THEIR OWN RIGHT, 
BUT ALL WERE ECLIPSED BY THE MOST EGREGIOUS OF ALL…
IN THE COMMOTION, THEY LEFT THE DOOR OPEN, 
AND MY PRECIOUS MRS. BIGGLESWORTH WAS LET OUT!”

You: “Mrs. Bigglesworth? Your…?”

DEMON LORD: “MY PRECIOUS DISPLACER KITTEN! 
THE ONLY THING I ENJOY MORE THAN 
MAIMING, TORTURING, AND CROCHETING! 
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN. 
BEFORE I DAMNED THEIR SOULS TO THE ABYSS, 
I “PERSUADED” THEM TO TELL ME WHO SENT THEM. 
ALL OF THEM ANSWERED THE SAME THING- 
‘NUMBER 74 FROM THE GUILD’. 
THAT’S WHY I’M HERE. 
YOU AND YOUR GUILD ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MY FURRY PARTNER’S DISAPPEARANCE, 
BUT I AM TOO WEAK TO UNLEASH MY FULL FURY UPON YOU ALL. 
BUT NOW THAT YOU HAVE GRANTED ME ACCESS TO YOUR SOUL, 
I HAVE THE MEANS OF REVENGE! 
YOU WILL BE MY GUY ON THE INSIDE- 
MY MOLE OF SORTS. 
YOUR LIFE IS NOW DEDICATED TO SENDING HEROES TO THEIR UNTIMELY DEMISES 
SO THAT THEIR SOULS MAY FUEL THE RITUAL I HAVE DEVISED 
AS A MEANS TO ESCAPE MY BONDAGE! 

You: “What if I say no?”

DEMON LORD: “THEN MY ‘DEMON LORD’S GRASP’ WILL SEND YOUR SOUL SCREAMING INTO OBLIVION! 
YOU HAVE TWO CHOICES, 
HELP ME AND RIGHT YOUR WRONG. OR DEFY ME AND BE ANNIHILATED!”

You: “Doesn’t look like I have much of a choice…”

DEMON LORD: “YOU DON’T! 
ISN’T IT GREAT! I LOVE BLACKMAIL! 
OH! BEFORE I SEND YOU ON YOUR TASK, I WILL ENLIGHTEN YOU WITH THIS BIT OF KNOWLEDGE-
 MORTALS HATE IT WHEN YOU SEND OTHERS TO THEIR DEATHS. 
OBVIOUSLY. 
THIS MEANS YOU SHOULD WATCH YOUR 
‘GUILD SUSPICION’ LEVELS
 TO ENSURE THEY DON’T PREMATURELY END OUR SUBTERFUGE. 
HAVE A WONDERFUL DAY AT WORK TOMORROW! 
BWAHAHAHAHA!”
